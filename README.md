# vemu

A toy emulator for the RISC-V ISA.  
Currently supports: RV64IMA full user-space emulation.
Partially supports: The F extension, the previliged ISA specification, and the
Newlib Linux syscall subset.

The emulator uses the Berkeley SoftFloat (release 3e) to carry out floating
point operations. The source of the library is included in the `vendor`
directory. The static library is prebuilt for only Windows for now.

## Building

vemu uses CMake, I prefer to use Ninja as a generator but a Makefile can be
generated by omitting the `-G Ninja` part from invoking CMake.

Currently, the interface is tied to emulating objdump against an input ELF file.
The tested command line is `objdump_riscv -x input_file`.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -G Ninja
ninja emu
./emu /path/to/objdump /path/to/input_file
```

## Testing

A subset of the RISC-V test suite is used to test vemu, a testing target can be
built and run against the available tests using the following commands, after
generating the ninja build files:

```
ninja test_emu
./test_emu
```

The test suite is organized in a manner that in each test, an `ECALL` 
instruction is invoked whether the test passed or not. A pass/fail value is set
in a register that we could check to see whether all tests have passed or not.
The testing target interposes `ECALL` instructions to do so.
